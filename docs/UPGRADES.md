# Azora OS Upgrade Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic upgrades planned for the Azora OS platform. These tasks are designed to enhance documentation, improve user experience, strengthen the backend, advance AI capabilities, and streamline infrastructure.

---

### 1. Documentation and Repository Health

A clean and well-documented project is crucial for collaboration and maintainability.

-   **Task 1: Create a Comprehensive README:** The main `README.md` should be populated with a project description, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines. *(Status: Completed)*
-   **Task 2: Reorganize Root Directory:** Move documentation files (`CONSTITUTION.md`, `GENESIS.md`, etc.) and images into the `/docs` folder to declutter the root.
-   **Task 3: Add Architectural Documentation:** Create a document inside `/docs` that explains the monorepo structure, the purpose of each app and service, and how they interact.

### 2. Frontend Enhancements (`/apps`)

The user-facing applications are critical for a good user experience.

-   **Task 4: UI/UX Redesign:** Conduct a review of the `driver-pwa` and any other applications in the `/apps` directory to identify and implement UI/UX improvements.
-   **Task 5: Add End-to-End Testing:** Implement end-to-end tests using a framework like Cypress or Playwright to ensure application reliability.
-   **Task 6: State Management Refinement:** Review the current state management solution and refactor for better performance and scalability.

### 3. Backend and API (`/api`, `/services`)

A robust backend is the heart of the platform.

-   **Task 7: API Documentation:** Auto-generate API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for the endpoints in the `/api` directory.
-   **Task 8: Database Optimization:** Analyze and optimize database queries in the Prisma schema (`/prisma`) to improve performance.
-   **Task 9: Service Decoupling:** Review the services in the `/services` directory to ensure they are loosely coupled and independently deployable.

### 4. AI and Machine Learning (`/ai-models`)

The AI capabilities are a key feature of Azora OS.

-   **Task 10: Enhance Route Optimization Model:** Integrate real-time traffic data, weather conditions, and vehicle type into the `route-optimization` model.
-   **Task 11: Develop a Predictive Demand Model:** Create a new AI model to forecast job demand based on historical data and trends.

### 5. Infrastructure and DevOps (`/infra`)

Solid infrastructure is key for a scalable and reliable platform.

-   **Task 12: Implement CI/CD Pipelines:** Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
-   **Task 13: Introduce Infrastructure as Code (IaC)::** Manage the Vercel deployment and other cloud resources using Terraform or a similar IaC tool.
